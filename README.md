# Process Management and Directory Listing w/o jailbreak

This is based on legit features of Xcode Developer Disk Image.

* Process Management: Just like `ps` and `kill`
* Directory Listing: Well, you still can't read anything. Just directory listing.

*Been stuck in my home for weeks because of COVID-19. Jeeez. Only a lame laptop and poor Internet. What else can I do to kill time except writing shitty projects...*
